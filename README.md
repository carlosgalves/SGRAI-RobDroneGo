# SGRAI-RobDroneGo

A 3D building and floor map with a custom character and camera (viewport) controller for navigation using ThreeJS.

This project has been developed according to the criteria defined in the ISEP SGRAI class of 2023. The project focuses on modeling/importing 3D models, user
interaction, animation/logic, lighting, and texture mapping. It also explores computer graphics techniques such as the use of multiple viewports, the creation of menus, picking/raycasting, transparencies, shadows, fog and other visual effects.
